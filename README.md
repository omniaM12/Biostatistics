Sample size calculations for the effect of the two treatment groups in addition to control group in chronic kidney disease patients
The minimum sample size with Assuming the 30% reduction in IS levels with treatment.1 administration is 37 in each group with adding 10% 
dropout to get with 41 patient in each group with an observed effect size of f = 0.3, a power of 80%, and a significance level of 5%. 

Sample size calculations for the effect of the two treatment groups in addition to control group in chronic kidney disease patients
The minimum sample size with Assuming the 30% reduction in IS levels with treatment.2 administration is 82 in each group with adding 10% 
dropout to get with 90 patient in each group with an observed effect size of f = 0.3, a power of 80%, and a significance level of 5%. 
 so we need a number of 90 patients in each group to cover the required sample size for applying the two treatment methods in addition to control group.

Sample size estimation was done using R software 4.4.0
